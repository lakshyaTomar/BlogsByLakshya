 In this Assigment I was asked to "Build a backend service using Java Spring Boot that allows users to create, retrieve, and
                                  manage blogs. The system should utilize JPA for database interactions, include a simple
                                  AI-powered text summarization feature, and be deployable on AWS."


Requirements for blog:
1. Backend APIs (Spring Boot + JPA)
● Create RESTful APIs for:
● Adding a new blog (title, content, author, createdAt).
● Fetching all blogs with pagination.
● Fetching a single blog by ID.
● Updating and deleting a blog.
● Use Spring Data JPA for database operations.
● Use PostgreSQL/MySQL as the database.



What I did in this project ?
   So to understand the architecture I have attaching (https://octopus.do/txuv98llqoe) a link for graphical representation of it. I hope it will help you to understand the project architecture easily.
